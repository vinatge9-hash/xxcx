# FitCore Studio - Gym Website

This project contains a complete, production-ready gym website generated from a single category prompt.

What you get:

- Four interconnected pages: Home (index.html), About (about.html), Programs (programs.html), Contact (contact.html)
- Tailwind CSS-based UI with a dark, bold gym aesthetic
- Category-appropriate typography and colors
- Background hero images via placeholder tokens and accessible alt text
- A comprehensive README with project structure and customization tips

How to run:

1. Open the four HTML files in a web browser: index.html, about.html, programs.html, contact.html
2. For local development, you can host these files with any static server (e.g., Python http.server, http-server npm package)

Notes:
- All styling is done with Tailwind CSS utilities (CDN-based).
- Font assets are imported from Google Fonts and wired via Tailwind config in the HTML head.
- Images are placeholders using the provided https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1757325331955-9ba8182dc44e?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3ODkyNDZ8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw1fHwuLi58ZW58MHwwfHx8MTc1OTU1NzMwNHww&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080 tokens. Replace with real URLs as needed. 

Extending:
- To add more pages, duplicate one of the HTML templates and update the navigation accordingly.
- Update the content blocks under the relevant pages to reflect the new features or offerings.
